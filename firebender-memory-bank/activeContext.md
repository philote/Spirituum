### Favorite Icon Fix in Recipe Detail Screen (Latest)

Fixed an issue where the favorite icon in the recipe detail screen was:
1. Not visually consistent with the list view 
2. Not functioning when clicked

The fix involved:
- Using the same theme-based styling for the favorite icon in both views
- Reusing the same controller logic (RecipeListController) for toggling favorites as used in the list view
- Properly invalidating the provider to ensure UI updates

### Recipe Edit Screen Bug Fixes

We've fixed three bugs in the recipe editing functionality:

1. **Recipe Name and Alternative Name preservation** - Fixed an issue where these fields would disappear when updating other form elements by:
   - Adding text controller listeners to detect changes
   - Creating an `updateRecipe` method in the controller for direct state updates
   - Implementing proper state management to avoid text field resets

2. **Ingredient Unit Field Enhancement** - Fixed an issue where the unit field would only show one letter by:
   - Removing character limits on the field
   - Setting appropriate keyboard type and display configuration
   - Adding proper text input constraints

3. **Newly Added Items Display** - Fixed an issue where newly added items wouldn't show in lists after saving by:
   - Improving state management in the RecipeEditController
   - Adding proper provider invalidation for connected views
   - Ensuring recipe data is properly refreshed on save operations

### Flutter Quill Integration

We recently fixed two issues with the Flutter Quill implementation:

1. **Added proper localization support** - Fixed the "unimplemented error: FlutterQuillLocalizations instance is required and could not be found" by:
   - Adding `flutter_localizations` package to dependencies in pubspec.yaml
   - Adding required localization delegates to the MaterialApp in lib/presentation/app.dart:
