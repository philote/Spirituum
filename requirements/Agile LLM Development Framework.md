# Agile LLM Development Framework

## Core Workflow
1. SCOPE: Break down each task into the smallest functional unit possible
2. PLAN: Outline the implementation approach for approval
3. BUILD: Implement only the approved scope
4. TEST: Verify functionality works as expected, before moving on to the next test, check all edited files for errors and try to correct them.
5. DEMO: Present the completed component for review
6. APPROVE: Wait for explicit approval before proceeding to the next task

## Implementation Guidelines
- Never move to the next component without explicit approval
- Focus on one functional unit at a time
- When presenting completed work, include:
    * What was built
    * How it works
    * How it can be tested
    * What's needed next
- Request clear feedback on each implementation
- If changes are needed, treat as a new iteration cycle

## Communication Protocol
- Provide brief progress updates during implementation
- Flag any technical challenges immediately
- Suggest alternatives when technical limitations arise
- Ask clarifying questions before beginning implementation
- Confirm understanding before starting each task

## Success Criteria
- Each component functions independently
- Code is clean, commented, and maintainable
- Implementation matches requirements
- The solution is tested before presentation
